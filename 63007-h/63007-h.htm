<p class="tb">Dedicated to <span class="sc">Domestic
Science</span> and to those who
are devoting their energy,
talent and time to the dissemination
of that knowledge which makes for
purer and better foods&mdash;to the Domestic
Science Teachers of America.</p>
<p class="tb">In response to hundreds of requests
from schools, colleges and
individuals for information regarding
the different varieties of
Spices we have prepared this booklet,
and have endeavored to give as
concisely as possible the facts necessary
to a thorough understanding
of the subject.</p>
<p>As there has hitherto been no complete
compilation along this line, it
has been necessary to obtain from
foreign sources much of the material,
while some of the illustrations represent
weeks of patient research by
our art department.</p>
<p>To the U. S. Department of Agriculture
we are indebted for much valuable
information, and for this we
wish to make due acknowledgment.</p>

<p>Pepper is the dried berry
of the pepper-plant (<i>Piper
nigrum</i>), a climbing
vine ten to twelve feet
high, indigenous to the
East Indies, but cultivated
in many tropical
countries.</p>

<p class="pcap">A Group of Pepper Mills</p>
</div>
<p>The berries are harvested
when they begin
to turn red, and the process
of drying out blackens
and shrivels them.
They are not picked
separately, but in spikes
or bunches, and are then
placed on mats to dry. At night the berries are placed under cover.</p>
<p>The average yield per vine is eight to ten pounds each year.</p>
<p>The different varieties of Black Pepper derive their name from
the localities in which they are grown or the ports whence they are
shipped, as Singapore, Lampong, Sumatra, Tellicherry, Acheen,
Malabar, Trang, etc.</p>
<h3 id="c2">White Pepper</h3>
<p>This is obtained by decorticating or removing the skin from the
fully ripened black peppercorns&mdash;accomplished by maceration.</p>
<p>White Whole Pepper grains are grayish white. They are more
nearly spherical in shape than the Black Pepper berries, and have
light-colored lines running from top to bottom. The more common
varieties are known as Siam, Singapore and Penang.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Red Pepper</h3>
<p>The U. S. Standards describe Red Pepper as the dried ripe fruit
of any species of capsicum, a genus of the <i>nightshade family</i> indigenous
to the American tropics. It is now cultivated in nearly all warm
and temperate countries, both commercially and in the kitchen-garden.
The leading commercial varieties are Zanzibar, Africa,
Indias, and Japan.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Paprika</h3>
<p>Paprika is botanically described as <i>Capsicum annuum</i>. The pods
are large and brilliant to dark red. It grows in the temperate and
torrid zones. It is cultivated principally in Spain (<i>Pimiinton</i>) and
Hungary. The Spanish-grown product is sweet and mild, the Hungarian
usually of a mildly pungent flavor. Paprika is used in cooking
for its color as well as flavor. It is rapidly finding favor among
American housewives.</p>

is usually darker in color than true Cinnamon, rougher, and about
four times as thick.</p>
<p>Cinnamon and Cassia range in value according to type and

<p>The Nutmeg-tree, genus <i>Myristica</i> (natural order <i>Myristicace&aelig;</i>),
native of the Malay Archipelago, usually grows to a
height of twenty to thirty feet. While the greater part of
the world&rsquo;s supply of both Nutmegs and Mace comes from the
Banda Islands, the West Indies are by no means to be overlooked.</p>
<p>The Nutmeg fruit is about three inches long and about two inches
in diameter. It includes, first, the outer or fleshy membranous part;
second, the substance covering the outer shell of the Nutmeg, known
as Mace, next the shell, and finally the kernel or commercial Nutmeg.</p>
<p>After harvesting, which in some places is done with long forked
sticks or bamboo poles, the red colored network (Mace) is removed
and the nuts are placed over a fire in mesh bottom receptacles,
where they remain for perhaps a month, being kept about ten feet
away from the flames. They are next exposed to the sun for two
or three hours daily for several days, or until the kernels rattle
within the shell. They are then removed from the shell and assorted
into three general grades.</p>
<p>Among the many varieties of Nutmegs the Singapore, Penang,
West Indian and Macassars are most esteemed, the price being
regulated by the type, size and quality of the nut.</p>
<p>During the past few years ground Nutmeg has been placed on
the market and is steadily finding favor with American housewives.</p>
<div class="img">

<h3 id="c9">Mace</h3>
<p>Mace is carefully removed from the shell
surrounding the kernel of the Nutmeg by
hand, although a knife is sometimes employed.
It is then placed on mats or trays to
dry in the sunshine. Of late years, however,
artificial drying has proven so successful that
it is rapidly supplanting the old method in
which the sunshine dissipated some of the
virtues of the Mace. Several months are required
to cure it. During this time it changes
from a crimson to a blood red and later to the
yellowish or golden brown color, in which state
it is found on the market here.</p>
<p>The Penang or Banda Mace is probably
the most desirable, with the Siauw and
Batavia following in the order named.</p>
<p>Great care must be exercised in the grinding
of Mace, as it is very rich in volatile oil.
Bee Brand Ground Mace is prepared in mills
especially designed for the purpose. Nutmegs
and Mace imported by McCormick &amp; Company
are marketed as Bee and Banquet Brands.</p>

<p>Unlike the Spices treated in this series,
Ginger is the root-stock of a plant
known botanically as <i>Zingiber officinale</i>,
an annual herb, three or four feet high. It is a
native of India and China, but is grown extensively
in tropical America, Africa and Australia.</p>
<p>The plant endures a wide range of climate.
It may be grown at sea level or in mountainous
regions, provided the rainfall be abundant or
irrigation adopted.</p>
<p>It is found cultivated from the Himalaya
Mountains, 5000 feet above sea level, to Cape
Comarin.</p>
<p>The root is dug when the plant is a year old
and after the stalk has withered.</p>
<p>Black Ginger, of which Calcutta and African
are the common varieties, is produced by
scalding the freshly dug roots. This prevents
sprouting.</p>
<p>White Ginger is the decorticated product,
the chief varieties being Jamaica, Cochin and
Japan. Jamaica is the most esteemed. Jamaica Ginger is best known
and most used here, although both Cochin and African Ginger are
imported in a large way.</p>
<p>The different varieties of Ginger are imported by McCormick &amp;
Company, who distribute them under the Bee Brand and Banquet
Brand guarantee. Green Ginger is the undried root. That received
in the United States is the Jamaica variety.</p>

<p class="pcap">Packeting Spices</p>

<p>The trees usually
grow in groups of from five to twenty, but are sometimes found in
forests. After the tree has attained a certain growth, the underbrush
and other Pimentos are cut away, leaving the trees about twenty-five
feet apart.</p>
<p>The Pimento flowers twice each year, but bears only one crop of
berries.</p>
<p>The problem of harvesting is the most serious with which the
planter has to contend. It is difficult to secure help among the
indolent natives, and as the harvest season is short&mdash;because the
berries must be picked just before they ripen&mdash;the loss from over-ripening
is very great. After harvesting, the berries are exposed
daily to the sun for a period of from seven to twelve days, being
placed under cover each night.</p>
<p>Pimento, or Allspice, as it is generally known, is exported principally
from Kingston, Jamaica, in 120 to 130 lb. bags, about one-third
of the crop coming to the United States, while the remainder finds its
way to England, whence it is exported to other countries.</p>
<p>As its common name implies, Allspice has a flavor which is
suggestive of the combined flavors of many spices.</p>
<p>McCormick &amp; Company import only the choicest Allspice grown
and market it under their Bee Brand and Banquet Brand trade

<p>Cloves are the dry flower-buds of an
evergreen (<i>Caryophyllus</i>, <i>Aromaticus</i>
or <i>Eugenia caryophyllata</i>) belonging
to the Myrtle family, averaging in height
twenty to forty feet. The Clove-tree is cultivated
in Ceylon, India, Mauritius, the
West Indies and Zanzibar. The different varieties
derive their names from the district
of origin or the city of exportation. Cloves
from Amboyna, Penang and Zanzibar are
perhaps best known and are in greatest demand.</p>
<p>The flowers grow in clusters. The green
buds change to a reddish hue, at which
stage they are removed from the tree, spread
in the sun and allowed to dry. When allowed
to fully fruit, the bud develops into a hard
seed an inch long, with a pulpy cover. This
is called Mother of Cloves.</p>
<p>The tree yields only one crop a year, the
yield under normal conditions being about
300 pounds to the acre. The average consumption
is estimated at 11,000,000 pounds per year.</p>
<p>There are a number of varieties of Cloves resembling each other
in appearance, but vastly different in pungency and flavoring value.</p>
<p>The slender stems bearing the closed buds have, to a limited degree,
the aromatic clove flavor, and as they sell for a very small
fraction of the cost of Cloves, are frequently powdered and used
for reducing the cost of Powdered Cloves, at the expense of quality
and of common honesty.</p>
<p>McCormick &amp; Company do not import, buy or sell Clove stems.
Their Bee and Banquet Brands Cloves, whole or ground, are carefully
selected for superior quality.</p>

<h3 id="c20">Mustard</h3>
<p>Mustard-Seed comes from Russia, Germany, England and Holland,
and to some extent from California. There are two chief divisions,
yellow and brown. The brown seed comes largely from Italy
and is known as Bari. The term Trieste is frequently applied to all
brown Mustard-Seeds.</p>
<p>Mustard-Seed contains two oils, known as Essential and Fatty.
The Essential Oil is soluble in water. In flavor and odor it closely
resembles horseradish. The Fatty Oil is mild and tasteless, insoluble
in water, and is sometimes used in place of olive oil.</p>
<p>In manufacturing Mustard-Flour the seed is warmed, subjected
to hydraulic pressure, which releases from fifteen to twenty-five per
cent of the fatty oil. The residue is called Mustard-Cake. It is ground
and bolted on fine sieves, separating the Mustard bran or hulls from
the interior, making ground mustard or flour. Brown seed contains
a larger percentage of the essential oil, and, therefore, makes a hotter
or stronger flour than the yellow variety, and must be blended with
flour from yellow seed.</p>

<p>The Vanilla-Bean is the
fruit of the <i>Vanilla
planifolia</i> or flat-leaved
Vanilla vine and is the
source from which pure
or true Vanilla Extract
is made. This climbing
perennial belongs to the
Orchid family and is indigenous
to Central and
South America, but
reaches its perfection of
flavor in Mexico. The
Mexican bean sometimes
attains a length
of ten inches.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="1061" height="808" />
<p class="pcap">One of the Extract Stills</p>
</div>
<p>When gathered, the beans are yellowish green, fleshy and without
odor. Their color and odor is developed by a process of fermentation
or sweating, which differs in various countries. The best method
consists of sun-drying for about a month, the beans being pressed
alternately between the folds of blankets and exposed to the air.
After curing they are tied in bundles. Vanilla-Beans when cured
exude and become covered with fine frostlike crystals of vanillin,
the important active flavoring principle.</p>
<p>Next in value to the Mexican bean comes the Bourbon, which
term is applied to all the Vanilla-Beans grown in the islands of the
Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa, of which Madagascar,
R&eacute;union, the Comores, Mauritius and the Seychelles are most important.
These beans are shorter than the Mexican, decidedly inferior
in flavoring quality, and, therefore, less expensive. They more
nearly resemble the Tonka bean in odor. The cheapest beans are the
Tahitis and so-called vanillons or beans of the wild Vanilla (<i>Vanilla
pompona</i>). They are little used in extract making, and properly so,
as they have neither strength nor flavor.</p>
<p>The Tonka bean is here mentioned simply because it is so largely
used in the manufacture of imitation Vanilla Extracts. It is the seed
of the <i>Dipterix odorata</i>, native to Guiana. The pod is almond shaped
and contains a single seed shaped like a kidney-bean. This bean is
dark in color, having a thin, shiny, brittle skin, containing a two-lobed
oily kernel. A hundred years ago these beans were found in
the snuffbox of every gentleman and in the handkerchief case of
every lady.</p>

Botanically, it is known
as <i>Camellis Thea</i> or

cultivation, it is kept
pruned to within three
to five feet high. The
constant pruning encourages
the growth of

<p class="pcap">Testing Tea</p>
</div>
<p>Teas are divided into two groups, which differ chiefly in the
method of curing. A tea-plant may produce a leaf which commercially
may be either black or green, depending on the treatment.</p>
<p>Green tea is prepared by steaming the fresh green leaf and
then drying it. In this way the bright color is preserved.</p>
<p>Black Tea is the result of oxidization or fermentation, caused by
exposing the leaves to the sun, which turns them black.</p>
<p>The best Teas are made from the young leaves, the different
varieties being graded according to their age and position on the
shoot.</p>
<p>Tea is produced in large quantities in China, Japan, India and

<p>There are about 200 varieties of Teas, and, perhaps, ten times
as many flavors. Tea ranges in value
from a few cents per pound for stems
up to $10.00 for the very finest leaf.</p>
<p>The Government inspects all teas
entering the United States, and those
below a certain standard are not allowed
to enter the country.</p>
<p>Tea drinking in the United States
is increasing, but the consumption is
still far behind that of many other
countries.</p>

<p>The average American housewife
has not given to the brewing of tea the
same careful consideration she gives to
the preparation of other beverages.
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Good Tea brewed right is a delicious beverage, but certain rules
must be observed.</p>
<p>Complete directions for the perfect brewing of Tea appear on each
package of Banquet Brand. Under this brand all the desirable
varieties are packed as well as a remarkable blend.</p>
<p>Our publication, &ldquo;Tea, Its Early History, and the Three Colonial
American Tea Parties,&rdquo; will be mailed free upon request.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">Flavoring Extracts</span></h2>
<p>The United States Agricultural Department, Circular No. 19,
contains the standards for foods. Among these are standards for
Flavoring Extracts. By this regulation Extract of Lemon must contain
at least 6.4 ounces of Oil of Lemon to 1 gallon of finished product,
or, as the circular puts it, 5 per cent Oil of Lemon by volume,
and Vanilla Extract the extractive matter from at least 13.35 ounces
of the bean to the gallon of finished product. The flavor is extracted
from the bean by a mixture of alcohol and water, as the resins in the
Vanilla-Bean will not impart their flavor to alcohol alone or to
water alone, but to a mixture containing from 40 to 60 per cent of
alcohol, according to character of bean. Long experience is required
to accomplish the results desired.</p>
<p>The Vanilla-Beans brought into this country range in price about
as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Mexican, $3.50 to $6.00 per pound.</p>
<p class="t0">Bourbon, $3.00 to $5.50 per pound.</p>
<p class="t0">Guadalupe, $3.00 to $5.50 per pound.</p>
<p class="t0">Seychelles, $3.25 to $4.50 per pound.</p>
<p class="t0">Tahiti, $1.75 to $2.50 per pound.</p>
</div>
<p>And a large variety, such as Java, South American and others,
ranging in price from $2.75 to $5.00 per pound.</p>
<p>These prices represent wholesale prices and vary from time to
time.</p>
<p>The use of Tahiti Beans, coming from the Islands of Tahiti,
has grown very largely in the last few years. They are much used
by manufacturers making the cheaper extracts.</p>
<p>The Vanilla-Bean dries out very quickly, but if properly cared
for and protected does not lose its strength. In fact, the flavor
greatly improves with age.</p>
<p>The same beans can be treated for extract by different persons
and an entirely different quality of goods produced, just as two
cooks can take the same kind of flour and one will produce a delightful
loaf of bread while the bread of the other will not be fit to eat.</p>
<p>We age our Bee Brand Extracts for two years in white oak casks
before placing them on the market. Thus they become mellow and
have a rich, dainty bouquet, which cannot be obtained by any
other process. The minimum cost of carrying large vats of Vanilla
is about 12 to 15 per cent per year. A fine, properly aged Extract
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
of Vanilla, such as Bee Brand, made from the best beans, would cost
from $8.00 to $9.00 a gallon to manufacture, and yet &ldquo;Strictly Pure
U. S. Standard Extracts&rdquo; can be made to cost not over $3.50 per
gallon.</p>
<p>Frequently you will find that a cheap pure Extract of Vanilla is
almost as strong as the fine, or high priced, Bee Brand goods, but
its flavor is rank and it has not the same bouquet and delicacy of
flavor, the comparison between the two being the same as that
between cheap cigars (three for 5 cents), which may be just as
strong as a fine Havana, or stronger, which costs 25 cents, but the
latter has a flavor and quality which the former do not approach.</p>
<p>The average consumer thinks if an Extract is pure it must be
good, and is satisfied with that statement. This belief on the part
of the consumer is largely due to the fact that many jobbers and large
retailers want their goods under their own names, requesting the
manufacturer to put up the cheapest Extract that will comply with
the law, regardless of the kind of beans or other materials used in
its manufacture. They simply ask for goods that comply with
State and National laws, but you can readily see what the word
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; means under this condition.</p>
<p>These jobbers and retailers think when they have complied with
the law they have done all that is necessary. We refuse positively to
sell our Bee Brand goods, or any other Flavoring Extracts, under
any other name than our own.</p>
<p>The consumer must realize that purity is one thing, strength
another, but <i>quality</i>, the cardinal feature by which to judge, can be
obtained only by buying goods under the name of a reputable manufacturer.</p>
<p>At one time the use of the ground or pulverized Vanilla-Bean
directly in the article to be flavored was considered by bakers and
ice-cream manufacturers a strong card to feature in their advertising.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of Domestic Science into so many of our
educational institutions, with the subsequent general interest which
the movement has aroused, the American housewife has come to
learn that by the use of the ground bean only one of the several
flavoring principles is obtained, <i>i. e.</i>, vanillin.</p>
<p>The other active agents may be obtained only by intensive processing,
and thus a full-toned extract is secured.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of &ldquo;Vanilla Compound,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Imitation
Vanilla,&rdquo; sold. This is made always from manufactured Vanillin or
Coumarin, or both. The natural Vanillin comes from Vanilla-Beans
themselves. Put a fresh Vanilla-Bean where it is very cold and
crystals will form on the outside. These crystals are pure Vanillin.
For a long time this was thought to be the only flavoring principle
of the Vanilla-Bean, but it has been proven to be only one of a
number.</p>
<p>The Vanillin in general use is manufactured by artificial means. It
is a white powdery substance with a strong Vanilla-like flavor, but it
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
lacks that softness which only Vanilla-Beans produce. In the process
of making cheap Extracts, Vanillin is frequently toned up in strength
and pungency with Coumarin.</p>
<p>Coumarin occurs naturally in Tonka Beans and Deer Tongue.
The Tonka Bean is a short, stumpy bean about 1&frac12; to 2 inches long
by &frac12; inch wide, and is used for flavoring tobacco. Coumarin is
made commercially from the leaves of Virginia Deer Tongue and is
manufactured in very large quantities, as it is cheaper than that
made from Tonka Beans.</p>
<p>It may be of interest to know that Bee Brand Flavoring Extracts
were awarded the only Gold Medal at the Jamestown Exposition,
and that we now have the only Gold Medal awarded Flavoring
Extracts since the National Pure Food laws have been in existence.</p>
<p>The Committee on Awards had no connection with the Exposition
Company, as it was appointed personally by Ex-President Roosevelt,
who named Dr. Harvey T. Wiley as chairman.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">The Bee Brand Manual of Cookery</span></h2>
<p>This book is the result of many years of conscientious effort to
produce a work which would be worthy of the title&mdash;The Blue Book
of the Culinary Art.</p>
<p>The old Colonial homes of Maryland and Virginia, long famous
for their &ldquo;Southern Cooking,&rdquo; have yielded most of the recipes.
Graduates of leading Schools of Domestic Science have thoroughly
tested and in some instances revised the recipes, so that in the new

<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c38"><span class="small">Quality vs. Purity</span></h2>
<p>The enactment of the National Pure Food Law in 1906 did
much toward awakening an interest in the purity of Foods
and Drugs, and while it has been beneficial in a general way,
it has had its disadvantages because it is not complete.</p>
<p>The people have been taught by the laws and the Pure Food propagandists
to believe that the word &ldquo;Pure&rdquo; upon a package ensures that
its contents are all right. Nothing can be further from the truth.</p>
<p>An article may be Pure and yet be of very Poor Quality; Purity
means little. Quality means much. For instance, a Keifer pear is a
Pure pear, yet in Quality it cannot be compared to the Bartlett pear.
Consider the difference in the quality of butter. Take a number of
samples of butter and you will find that some of them will be unfit
to eat, and others a delight to use, yet they are all Pure butter, and
the difference is in the Quality. The tobacco in a &ldquo;five-for-a-nickel&rdquo;
stogie may be a Pure tobacco, but it cannot be placed in a class with
that of an imported Havana cigar selling at twenty-five cents.</p>
<p>A Spice may be Pure, and yet come from a country known to
produce inferior Spices. It may be Pure and yet inert. Consider the
difference in Quality between Acheen Pepper and Tellicherry. They
are both Pure peppers.</p>
<p>A Vanilla Flavoring Extract made from rank Tahiti Beans costing
$1.50 a pound is a pure Extract of Vanilla, but how does its quality
compare with that made from high-grade
Mexican beans, costing $6.00 a pound?
So it goes all down the line.</p>

<p>The time is coming when consumers
will realize that the important thing to
look for in the purchasing of foodstuffs
is not the word &ldquo;Pure&rdquo;&mdash;but the name
of the reputable manufacturer whose
dealings are beyond reproach.</p>

<p>Gentlemen: For twenty years past I&rsquo;ve been
using Bee Brand Extracts and Spices, and ever
since you&rsquo;ve added Teas to your products, I&rsquo;ve
used Banquet Blend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the finest tea I know of and it pleases all
our guests.</p>
<p>If you care to use this letter, you have my

<h2 id="c39"><span class="small">Banquet Brand Tea</span></h2>
<p>In this big drum all
the dust and foreign
matter is removed
from Banquet Tea.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vacuum process,
and it acts in such
a way as to thoroughly
mix and blend the Teas
when two or more are
worked together.</p>

<p class="pcap">Vacuum Tea Cleaner</p>
</div>
<p>There are few Tea
houses similarly equipped.
Among the 2000
flavors in Tea, the problem
of selection and
combining is big. It
takes expert knowledge to produce a Tea like <span class="sc">Banquet Blend</span>.
Four successive generations of Tea experts produced the man who
weened Banquet Blend from among the many flavors.</p>
<p>Teas from the highlands of Ceylon, from the interior of China
and from the hillsides of Japan&mdash;all blended in one masterful creation&mdash;the
triumph of the tea-blender&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>In Banquet Blend there is a delicacy of flavor, a richness of
bouquet, a certain subtle softness, and none of that rankness which
is found in so many brands of tea.</p>
<h3 id="c40">Bee Brand Extracts</h3>
<p>There are few houses engaged in the manufacture of Flavoring
extracts which have at their disposal a laboratory such as this.</p>
<p>Early in their business
career McCormick
&amp; Company realized
that eternal vigilance in
extract making would
be the keynote of success.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="1058" height="818" />
<p class="pcap">A Corner of the Laboratory</p>
</div>
<p>The services of expert
chemists were
engaged, a modern laboratory
equipped and
the work of producing
the world&rsquo;s finest flavors
begun. The task was not
easy, nor has the expense
been light, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
today, and for a number
of years past, these
pioneers in the field of
purer foodstuffs have
been reaping the harvest
of seed sown years
ago.</p>
<p>During the two
years which are required
to &ldquo;process&rdquo; most Bee
Brand Flavoring Extracts
the goods are
sealed in big white oak
casks, where much of
their characteristic mellowness
is acquired.</p>

<p>The making of Flavoring Extracts has long since been reduced to
a science, or, if you prefer, elevated to the station of an art. For
twenty-five years the manufacturers of Bee Brand Flavoring Extracts
have been the first to experiment with whatever innovations
which have offered for the betterment of the trade. In spite of
many experiments, the changes have not been drastic&mdash;the process
remains much the same.</p>
<h3 id="c41">Bee Brand Spices</h3>
<p>The rows of spice-mills, illustrated on <a href="#Page_5">page 5</a>, are always of
interest to the guest. Long before one comes to the spice department
the fragrant, pungent aroma drifts out in friendly greeting. Big
electrically-driven mills pound away hour after hour, day after day,
turning out savory Bee Brand Spices to tempt the fickle appetite
of a busy work-a-day world.</p>
<p>In this building one finds the products of the four corners of the
globe. It is, indeed, easy to understand Sheba&rsquo;s tribute to Solomon
when she selected spices from among all the good things the world
affords and sent them to his court.</p>
<p>Here is the atmosphere of the Old World mingled with the commercialism
of the New.</p>
<hr />
<p>A cordial invitation is extended you to visit the Bee Brand Plant
when you are in Baltimore. Courteous guides are at your disposal
from 10 <span class="sc">A. M.</span> to 4 <span class="sc">P. M.</span> each day. Every nook and corner of this
great institution is open for your inspection&mdash;there is nothing under
cover, nothing to conceal.</p>
<p>The management wants you personally to see the sanitary manner
in which the plant is run&mdash;the smiling faces of contented employees,
who find their pleasure in their work. No note of discord here! Occasionally
a &ldquo;kicker&rdquo; drifts in, but not for long. He has no place
in &ldquo;the spirit of the hive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These chefs and stewards are members of the International
Mutual Cooks and Pastry Cooks Association, and they have unreservedly
endorsed Bee Brand Flavoring Extracts as the highest in
quality.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t guess at it&mdash;they know! They have tried and tested
them in comparison with all other brands of extracts worthy of any
consideration at all. There was only one possible verdict! Bee Brand
was found superior in mellowness of flavor, in quality of ingredients;
in fact, in every way.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, Bee Brand Extracts were found to cook out less
readily than any other extract and to impart a finer fruit flavor than
could be secured in any other way.</p>
<p>This is as it should be. Bee Brand Extracts are the perfected
result of twenty-five years&rsquo; experience in scientific Extract Making.
The highest quality raw materials are used exclusively and after
intensive processing, Bee Brand Extracts are aged in white oak
casks to bring out their distinctive mellowness of flavor.</p>
<p>Bee Brand Extracts were awarded the only Gold Medal at the
Jamestown Exposition and have been endorsed by &ldquo;Good Housekeeping
Magazine,&rdquo; Westfield Board of Health and the highest
authorities in Domestic Science.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
